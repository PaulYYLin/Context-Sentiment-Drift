I could not believe that the same conspiracy theorists are trying to detract people from even watching the 1st episode with comments like \"I could not finish the first episode because ...blah blah\". Yes the truth might hurt them. But please hear the experts. What is tough, and these episodes demonstrate that, is the fact that those naysayers are very hard to dissuade even when presenting them with known facts from experts.<br />As a side note, the only thing I never could stand about Borat is the tacky, sometimes vulgar jokes, and they get tired after so many repetitions.",

However, too many producer/directors overextend themselves by attempting to act in their own films, now matter how large or small the production. Anthony D.P. Mann commits the cardinal sin of playing the title role, even though he in no way resembles the character. Sadly, he is no Orson Welles. He should have spent more time teaching his amateur supporting cast how to properly project their characters to the camera.",

Sadistic, Perhaps. Still the mechanics of his style are unique and all filmmakers should study with care his ingenious ability to drag you through his world with your eyes wide open in horror.",

I enjoyed his personality and some of his designs. However, his final runway was so strange  I felt it was a insult for the program. Naked bottoms and headless models is not fashion just strange. Sad I am not looking for any future Seasons.",

His entire collection, to me, was more avant garde and not at all wearable. I cannot believe they chose him over Rafael. Very disappointed. I loved Georgia and Jeannette - Georgia spoke to all body sizes and her clothes were very wearable.<br />Bring Back Zac Posen to replace Jeremy PLEASE!",

Much appreciated as an adult tho! Best horror movie yet of 2020",
