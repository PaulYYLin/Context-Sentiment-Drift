It helps if you start the movie at an emotional medium level, but an emotional high would be better because it might bring you down.  I liked it though, watch it if you like dark comedies.\",\n",

    "* Scoring standard is a 1–5 star scale (1 = very negative, 5 = very positive), emulating typical review ratings.\n",

    "  * Continuous score (0–1): indicating sentiment polarity\n",
    "  * Transformed star rating (1–5): comparable to the baseline\n",
    "  * JSON example: `{\"text\": ..., \"score\": 0.83}`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Difference Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare sentiment score changes across variants for the same original review\n",
    "* Measure pre/post context sentiment shifts (mean, standard deviation)\n",
    "* Analyze which context types (e.g., negative endings) have the strongest influence\n",
